    "\n",
    "If you need to run different versions of Python (e.g., 2.7 and 3.6), consider using the conda environment infrastructure.  A Conda environment is a new Python installation that lives alongside any other base installations or environment installations you already have.  Essentially every Conda environment is a separated Python installation. When you want to use the specific python in the environment, you activate the environment. Activation prepares a command window and sets up the paths to the Python version in that specific environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principle here is that you create a thin root installation environment  that has the bare essentials to support conda and not much more.  You then create [conda environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) where you can install full anaconda versions of the the appropriate Python revisions.  You do the real work in the environments by activating the environment before running the python and packages in that environment.  When you create environments in conda, it creates a more or less complete Python installation in the ..../envs/ directory in an existing miniconda or anaconda installation.  So the multiple versions are installed side by side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activating an environment must be done in a command window; where the process of activation simply modifies the system level paths from the root environment to the newly activated environment.  The new environment is active in the present command window until the environment is deactivated, which means that the original paths to the Python folders are restored back to the root environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended practice to keep a small root environment, solely as a tool to create new environments - all the real work is done in the specially created environments.  This is a means to control which package versions for development, testing and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Python version 3.7). Note that the choice of which Miniconda is installed only affects the root environment. Regardless of which version of Miniconda you install, you can still install both Python 2.7.x and other Python 3.x environments.  \n",

The installation does complete, but there are warnings that for some tasks admin rights are required.  Within the scope of my Python work, there never was a problem, but to install without any warning, start the command console as admin before installing conda/anaconda.\n",

    "\n",
    "     `<where installed>\\.\\envs\\<enironment name>\\.\\Lib\\site-packages`\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `*pth` file\n",

    "To tell Python about your special installation folder, place a `<module name>.pth` file in the `site-packages` directory in the environment where this package must be available. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if I cloned the `https://github.com/NelisW/pyradi` module from github to my hard disk at `V:\\work\\WorkN\\pyradi`, I can place a file in the root and or environment `site-packages` folder(s)  with the name `pyradi.pth` that contains the line `V:\\work\\WorkN\\pyradi\\pyradi`.  Note that in this case `pyradi` is installed at a particular location, but the path written to the file is further down the folder structure with an additional `pyradi`.  This is because the module is actually one level deeper.\n",

    "If you use the `.pth` method, Python does not know if it is a local folder structure, a repository, or a pypi installation, just so long as it has legal Python module code, all is fine. \n",

    "I have not done this yet, but in principle you can have many different versions of a module in different directories on your PC (e.g. for testing with different versions of Python, or with different functionality for whatever reason).  You can then create different conda environments where each environment has its own unique and different `.pth` file, pointing to the specific code you want to use with that specific environment.  The different `.pth` files must then be placed in each environment's own `site-packages` directory, to be used with that specific environment.\n",

    "To checkout the [pyradi repo](https://github.com/NelisW/pyradi) from github you *do not* need a github account.  You only need to create a github account if you want to create repositories on GitHub. So initially, no need to get an account.\n",

    "If the file is created in Windows, the line ending is not Linux friendly.  Windows uses carriage return and line feed `\\r\\n`, whereas Linux uses just a line feed `\\n`.  This means that if the file is created on Windows and executed on Linux the operating system is searching to execute the file `python\\r`, which is very different from the intended `python`.  I tried converting the file from Windows to Linux format by using the `fromdos` command, but that did not fix the line ending problem.  Opening and closing the file in `nano` did not help either.  The only remedy was to (1) open the file in Linux (e.g. in `nano`), move to the top of the file, (2) manually type in the whole first line followed by `Enter` a few times, making very sure that a new Linux line ending is introduced, and (3) then remove the old line with the bad line ending.\n",
