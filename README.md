Computational Optical Radiometry
================================

Notebooks to demonstrate the use of the 
[pyradi](https://code.google.com/p/pyradi/)
 module for computational optical radiometry.

The [pyradi](https://code.google.com/p/pyradi/) toolkit is a Python toolkit to perform optical and infrared radiometry (flux flow) calculations.
The toolkit is an extendable, integrated and coherent collection of basic functions, code modules, documentation, example templates, unit tests and resources, that can be applied towards diverse calculations in the electro-optics domain. 

The notebooks above are rendered in HTML following these links:
